## 📝 Requirements

With a **layout design** as the starter point, the exercise consists on developing a web-site using the following **elements**:

- **Sass**
- **React**

The following **requirements** have to be respected:

- A **React** project will be created in its latest version. 
- A **basic routing system** will be created with the options that can be seen in the images where only the page to layout (declarations) will have the content. 
- The creation of **react components in order to reuse code** will be valuated. 
- The layout **.scss files** (when you create the angular project choose it like this) ought to be used and the advantages of this will be valuated.
- Must have a resolution **below 900px**.

## 🛠️ Tools

The following tools have been used when solving the project:

- **HTML** (with partials for an easier lecture and project organization)
- **CSS/Sass**
- **Partials**
- **Variables, mixins and functions**
- **Flexbox**
- **Box model** (size, padding and margin)
- **Media queries**
- **Position**
- **Transition**
- **GIT version control**
- **UseState**

## 💾 Steps to follow to use this project on your computer:

> **NOTE:**  You need to have **Node JS** installed to run this project.

1. **Go to github.com/your-user/name-of-project**, **clone it** and do whatever you want, you can rename the repo, change the code, redeploy it to GitHub Pages...
2. **Finally** and for everything to work properly, **you must disable GitHub Pages and re-enable** it so that GitHub generates the new URL correctly.
3. Open it in your code editor.
4. Open a terminal and **install the local dependencies** by executing in the command terminal. Here are the ones I used to start my project:

```bash
npm install 
npm install node-sass
npm install react-router-dom

```
The project has to be **started** every time we start programming, to do this we will execute the **command**:

```bash
npm start
```
After running `npm start` we can start editing all the files inside the src/ folder and program comfortably 💫
